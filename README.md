# Holiday Trees
We're celebrating the winter drawing near and holidays approaching by creating holiday trees using HTML & CSS!

## Offset Some Carbons
Because we're planting virtual trees, might as well plant some real ones too! For 2017, I will be offsetting 1 metric ton of carbon through the [Nature Conservancy|http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/help/carbon-offset-program-frequently-asked-questions.xml#1] for every 3 trees "planted"\*. 

## Pull Request Requirements:
1. Your parent container must be square
2. You must have added something new and unique to your tree
3. You must add your name or initials to the name box

_Please add these requirements in a list in your pull request comment, as shown in the example below:_

*Example:*
1. Container is a square - 350x350px
2. I added a star to the top!
3. Initials added: MK

\*I may have to do some re-evaluating after $300, however. :)
